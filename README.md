# Unexpected Multiple Data Fetches in Next.js with useEffect

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where data fetching or side effects within `useEffect` hooks trigger multiple times unexpectedly. This can lead to performance problems and incorrect rendering.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple Next.js component that fetches data or performs a side effect using `useEffect`.  Due to a common Next.js lifecycle peculiarity, the effect runs more than once, leading to potential issues such as redundant API calls or unexpected state updates.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation. It addresses the problem by using techniques to manage the lifecycle of the `useEffect` hook more effectively. This often involves a combination of careful dependency management and optional cleanup functions within the `useEffect` hook.
